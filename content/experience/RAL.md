{{< columns >}}

### Engineering Design Process

I was involved in all of the following steps:

1. Project ideation
1. Definition of requirements
1. Concept design
1. Iterative CAD design/drawings
1. Sensor selection and integration
1. Finite Element Analysis (hand calculations, static, impulse)
1. Prototyping
1. Controller design
1. Testing protocol (benchtop and on person)
1. Detailed design report
1. Iteration

<--->

### Detailed Design
I gained exposure into various facets of mechanical design including:

* System level FEA and subassembly analysis
* Controller design and debugging
* Sensor suite selection and testing
* Additive manufacturing and part tolerancing
* Design for human interaction
* Optimizing custom designs
* Rapid prototyping and iteration
