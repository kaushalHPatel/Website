## Project Overview
At Tesla I was given one main overarching project that had 2 associated subprojects. I was given an expansion valve for the next generation heat pump which was not meeting internal standards. The valve had high leakage in the completely closed configuration. My project was to find the root cause of this leakage and propose corrective action.
