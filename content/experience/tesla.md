## Project Overview
At Tesla, I was assigned one main overarching project. I was responsible for the root cause investigation of expansion valves in the vehicle wide heat pump system which were not meeting internal standards. The valve had high leakage across the orifice in the completely closed configuration and my project was to characterize the leakage, determine the failure points, and propose corrective design changes. 

I expanded the scope of this project to create in-house refrigerant testing capabilities and develop a Python test harness to automate valve testing.

### Engineering Design Process

I was involved in all of the following steps:

1. Project ideation
1. Definition of requirements
1. Concept design
1. Iterative CAD design/drawings
1. Sensor selection and integration
1. Finite Element Analysis (hand calculations, static, impulse)
1. Prototyping
1. Controller design
1. Testing protocol (benchtop and on person)
1. Detailed design report
1. Iteration

### Detailed Design
I gained exposure into various facets of mechanical design including:

* System level FEA and subassembly analysis
* Controller design and debugging
* Sensor suite selection and testing
* Additive manufacturing and part tolerancing
* Design for human interaction
* Optimizing custom designs
* Rapid prototyping and iteration
