## Project Overview

At Tesla, I was assigned one main overarching project. I was responsible for the root cause investigation of expansion valves in the vehicle wide heat pump system which were not meeting internal standards. The valve had high leakage across the orifice in the completely closed configuration and my project was to characterize the leakage, determine the failure points, and propose corrective design changes. 

I expanded the scope of this project to create in-house refrigerant testing capabilities and develop a Python test harness to automate valve testing.
