In my free time, I generally like to soak up the sun and engage in outdoor activities. Living in Irvine grants me access to lots of great spots for hiking, cycling, and swimming at the beach. When I'm not outside, I like to bake desserts and watch Formula 1!

## Hiking
Last summer I was fortunate enough to visit both Zion National Park in Utah and Mount Rainier National Park in Washington. The beauty isn’t just in the view; it’s in the scale, the stillness, and the experience of being truly present.

## Baking
I've always had a sweet tooth and wanted to learn how to make some of my favorite desserts at home. Baking is fun because recipes are very forgiving, there's a lot of experimentation possible, and I love sharing sweet treats with my friends. Some of my favorite bakes include Peppermint Matcha Cookies, Pumpkin Bread, and the viral Coffee Cake Cookies from Gilmore Girls!

I try to bake using gluten free flour and egg substitutes like apple sauce or greek yogurt. I find that greek yogurt adds more moisture and results in a softer texture which I like.

## Cycling 
When the weather is nice and I have a few spare hours on the weekend, I try to get out and ride my single speed road bike. Irvine has some great trails that lead from the UCI campus out to Newport Beach. Here are some of my favorite pictures I have taken while on a ride:
